This technique is to be used with care since it can cause lockouts and a lot of noise, depending on the target organization&#39;s policies.</li><li>Default passwords: certain technologies come with default passwords that are often left unchanged. This technique is similar to the &quot;common passwords&quot; technique, but generates less noise and has fewer chances of locking out an account.</li><li>Situational guessing: there are many cases where user passwords are not common and yet easily guessable when knowing the organization&#39;s vocabulary and context.</li></ul><h2 id="practice" tabindex="-1">Practice <a class="header-anchor" href="#practice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practice&quot;">​</a></h2><h3 id="common-passwords" tabindex="-1">Common passwords <a class="header-anchor" href="#common-passwords" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Common passwords&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Depending on the target service, different lists of common passwords (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/danielmiessler/SecLists/tree/master/Passwords/Common-Credentials" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">the SecLists ones</a>) and different tools can be used.</p><ul><li><a href="https://github.com/vanhauser-thc/thc-hydra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Hydra</a> (C) can be used against a lot (50+) of services like FTP, HTTP, IMAP, LDAP, MS-SQL, MYSQL, RDP, SMB, SSH and many many more.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/Pennyw0rth/NetExec" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">NetExec</a> (Python) can be used against LDAP, WinRM, SMB, SSH and MS-SQL.</li><li><a href="https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Kerbrute</a> (Go) and <a href="https://github.com/ShutdownRepo/smartbrute" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">smartbrute</a> (Python) can be used against <a href="./../../kerberos/pre-auth-bruteforce">Kerberos pre-authentication</a>.</li></ul><div class="tip custom-block"><p>netexec has useful options for password guessing</p><ul><li><code>--no-bruteforce</code>: tries user1 -&gt; password1, user2 -&gt; password2 instead of trying every password for every user</li><li><code>--continue-on-success</code>: continues authentication attempts even after successes</li></ul><p>Smartbrute has equivalent features</p><ul><li><code>--line-per-line</code>: equivalent of netexec&#39;s <code>--no-bruteforce</code> option</li><li><code>--stop-on-success</code>: reversed equivalent of netexec&#39;s <code>--continue-on-success</code> option</li></ul></div><h3 id="default-passwords" tabindex="-1">Default passwords <a class="header-anchor" href="#default-passwords" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Default passwords&quot;">​</a></h3><p>This technique can be used with the same tools as the &quot;common passwords&quot; technique but with short and specific password lists.
