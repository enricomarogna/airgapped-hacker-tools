It usually does so by flooding the targeted machine with a consequent amount of requests to overload the system or by exploiting logic flaws that make the target server compute way too much.</li><li>Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS): a DDoS attack has the same goal as the DoS attack. Except it uses a multitude of compromised machines to cause a denial of service and usually relies on flooding rather than finding and exploiting logical flaws.</li></ul><p>There are various ways to cause a denial of service by flooding such as:</p><ul><li>MAC flooding: flooding a switch with packets using different source MAC addresses.</li><li>ARP poisoning/spoofing: linking multiple IP addresses with a single MAC address (to a target).</li><li>Slow HTTP: sending HTTP requests in a slow and fragmented way, one at a time.</li><li>File upload: exhausting the back-end system&#39;s disk space and network bandwidth by uploading lengthy files. Also, uploading a file that will be interpreted in the back-end could cause a DoS, if the file uploaded is malicious and its goal is to overload the system.</li><li>ICMP flood: flooding the targeted machine with an overwhelming amount of ICMP requests.</li></ul><p>The list is not exhaustive however, one can keep in mind that multiple categories exist, presenting a different approach for conducting a DoS attack: bandwidth, packets, TCP-related components, application layer, etc.</p><p>Testing for DoS in engagements can be useful for detecting applications and configurations vulnerabilities, by then providing the client with possible mitigation to prevent DoS attacks.</p><h2 id="practice" tabindex="-1">Practice <a class="header-anchor" href="#practice" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Practice&quot;">‚Äã</a></h2><h3 id="websites" tabindex="-1">Websites <a class="header-anchor" href="#websites" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Websites&quot;">‚Äã</a></h3>',10)),s(r,null,{default:i(()=>[s(n,{label:"Stress testing"},{default:i(()=>a[0]||(a[0]=[e("p",null,[e("a",{href:"https://github.com/antirez/hping",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},"hping3 "),t("is a tool for firewall testing, OS fingerprinting, port scanning, etc. (see "),e("a",{href:"https://linux.die.net/man/8/hping3",target:"_blank",rel:"noreferrer"},"manual"),t(")."),e("br"),t(" What's interesting is its DoS testing capabilities.
