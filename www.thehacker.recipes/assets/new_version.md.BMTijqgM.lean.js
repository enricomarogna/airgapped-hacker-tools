We also realized that some GitBook features, which initially seemed beneficial, were actually locking us in (e.g., the discontinued gitbook-cli, lack of control over slugs and redirection settings, new custom blocks, native markdown blocks modified and becoming incompatible with other md renderers).</p><p>Last but not least, given GitBook&#39;s expensiveness, we were concerned that losing the &quot;Community&quot; plan for any reason would be risky, as we wouldn&#39;t be able to afford the paid plans and would have no viable alternatives.</p><h2 id="version-2-0" tabindex="-1">Version 2.0 ðŸš€ <a class="header-anchor" href="#version-2-0" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Version 2.0 :rocket:&quot;">â€‹</a></h2><p>In July 2023, we made the decision to leave GitBook. <strong>We spent one year</strong> searching for alternatives, developing our own solution, going back and forth a lot, while putting new contributions and articles on hold...</p><p>We are now proud <em>(and relieved)</em> to present The Hacker Recipes v2 ðŸŽ‰</p><ul><li>Contributors are now highlighted</li><li>Faster loading times on big articles</li><li>Ability to access The Hacker Recipes offline (<em>work in progress</em>)</li></ul><details class="details custom-block"><summary>Note for past contributors</summary><p>A lot of changes made through GitBook don&#39;t show properly in the git log, effectively preventing us from pulling all contributors.
